I am an associate professor of the Center for Translational AI Excellence and Applications in Medicine (TEAM-AI) at McWilliams School of Biomedical Informatics, UTHealth Houston. With a diverse background in informatics, medicine, pharmacology and public health, I have a strong focus on translating informatics solutions for cancer, precision medicine, mental health, pharmacovigillance and pharmacogenomics. I have extensive collaborations with clinicians, epidemiologists, and statisticians, served as a co-investigator and key investigator for multiple research grants from the National Library of Medicine (NLM) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI). 

I have lead numerous informatics projects aimed at creating valuable assets, such as lexicons, ontologies, and natural language processing algorithms. These resources have proven effective in extracting large-scale information and conducting data mining. I make use of diverse real-world data sources, such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS), to produce evidence that supports both research endeavors and practical applications, contributing to excellence in these fields.
